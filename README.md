# Intelligent Automated Rice Cooker: IoT and Machine Learning-based Solution

This project introduces a **React Native mobile application** for controlling an **Intelligent Automated Rice Cooker** system. The system integrates **IoT** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to automate rice cooking, making it more efficient and user-centric.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start Metro

Run the following command to start **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Build and Run Your App

With Metro running, open a new terminal window and use the following commands:

#### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### iOS

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

### Step 3: Modify Your App

Make changes to the app by editing `App.tsx`. The app will automatically update with **Fast Refresh** when changes are saved.
